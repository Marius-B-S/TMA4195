Mathematical Modelling - Fall 2024

In this project we studied the global temperature on earth through simple mathematical models.
In the first part of the project we studied radiative heat transfers. We did not look at the full
spectrum of radiation, but rather consider two systems, namely short and long waves. These
systems was modeled with and without clouds, and combined they make it possible to study
how cloud coverage influences the temperature on earth and in the atmosphere.

In the second part of the project we focused on the polar regions. As ice is more reflective than
the rest of the earthâ€™s surface, the size of these regions directly influence the global temperature.
At the same time, the regions grow and shrink with lower and higher global temperature. We use the heat equation in order to study how the temperature depends on the polar regions.
